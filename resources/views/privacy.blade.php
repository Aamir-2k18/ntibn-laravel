                    <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your
                        information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to
                        us.
                        However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment
                        transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are
                        required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
                        For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand
                        the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
                        In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are
                        located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a
                        transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your
                        information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service
                        provider or its facilities are located.
                        As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment
                        gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that
                        transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the
                        Patriot Act.
                        Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or
                        application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of
                        Service.
